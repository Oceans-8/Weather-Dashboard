Module 6 Challenge Waether Application

# Project
Create a weather application

# Project Description
The aim of this project was to create a weather application that takes location inputs and displays data from an online weather API

# Functionality
The final output is a well designed page that takes user search inputs and displays current weather and a 5 day weather forecast. Additional information dsiplayed includes wind speed, humidity and an icon representing the conditions. Each search result is stored in local storage and then a button is created and listed under the search bar. This button can then be clicked to again reveal the 
This was achieved through API calls to a site listed below. Firstly, the user input had to be converted to co-ordinates which would then be fed into the second API call.
The final product satisfies the requirements required. If I had more time, additional things I would consider dealing with specific situations. For example: when a location that has already been searched, is searched for again. Currently, the app just creates an additional identical button, but perhaps it makes more sense not to create an additional button for the search input in this scenario.
